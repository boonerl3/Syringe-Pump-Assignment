Specifications of the syringe pump:

### Steps per mL calculation 
Pitch of 8mm threaded rod = 1.25mm
Linear distance/step = lead/steps = 1.25mm/3200 steps = 0.00039 mm/step
Plunger diameter = 19mm
Volume = π*(19mm/2)<sup>2</sup> * 0.00039mm = 0.11mm<sup>3</sup> = 0.11 μL.
**(Resolution is 0.11 μL/step), therefore steps/mL = 9,029 steps.**

### Max flowrate
Limiting factors could be: torque, viscosity of the fluid, speed of digital inputs to the driver. 


Reasons why you should build and program your own pump: customize to volume requirements.
